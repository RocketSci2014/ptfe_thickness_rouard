# 1. Read data from data/离轴7.5°聚四氟乙烯薄片.xls and then extract timings and amplitudes of the THz signal.Regarding the
# reference signal and the signal reflected from film, figure out how to calculate the phase delay.

# 2. Study the FFT (fast Fourier transform) and figure out how to convert the reference signal and reflected signal to
# frequency domain.

# 3. Figure out how to simulate the reflected signal based on the reference signal using the aforementioned phase delay.

# 4. Figure out how to convert the simulated signal to time domain and build the optimization function using MSE.
